      # NH4Nstock to Soil Ammonium-N
      # NO3Nstock to Soil Nitrate-N
      # GLU_gSoil to GLU, and similar for other EEA

# Main Text Figures: Boxplots ---------------------------------------------
# will be based off of the process in anova_script.R
# TODO: 
#   * colors: 
#       set conventional to black 
#       differentiate between conv.cc.X and org.cc.X using colors 
#   * place p-values in the figure (if it looks nice)
#   * add black line at y=0 if y=0 exists on the y axis as normally plotted. 
#   * make axis titles nice





# Main Text Figures: Seasonal ---------------------------------------------
# will be based off of the process in temporal_script.R
# TODO: 
#   * reorder the facets in the seasonal plots. 
#   * remove "value" from the y axis label
#   * add black line at y=0 if y=0 exists on the y axis as normally plotted. 
#   * colors: use colors to differentiate between years
